# Project Euler Solutions

## Description

These are my solutions to the first ten [Project Euler](http://www.projecteuler.net/) problems. Probably not the fanciest or the most performant, but they get the job done.

The C and Ruby solutions are "complete" insofar as they work; the Haskell solutions are still in progress.
