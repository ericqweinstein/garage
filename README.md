Practice projects, puttering around.

#### Contents

Things move in as I start small new projects that don't have an immediate home & things move out as they get big enough to deserve their own repos.

* /codepoem: A web application designed to demonstrate the intersection between programming and poetry. (Currently just serves the COMING SOON page.)
* /conway: Conway's Game of Life in JavaScript.
* /spock: An IRC chat bot written in Haskell, more or less straight from [the Haskell wiki](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Roll_your_own_IRC_bot). He doesn't do much yet.
* /wwd: "What's Weinstein Doing," a tiny Clojure app I made that displays my most recent tweet.
