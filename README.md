Garage
======
Practice projects, puttering around.

#### Contents

Things move in as I start small new projects that don't have an immediate home & things move out as they get big enough to deserve their own repos.

* /cci: Some of my solutions to questions in _Cracking the Coding Interview_ (5th edition).
* /conway: Conway's Game of Life in JavaScript.
* /spock: An IRC chat bot written in Haskell, more or less straight from [the Haskell wiki](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Roll_your_own_IRC_bot). He doesn't do much yet.
* /wwd: "What's Weinstein Doing," a tiny Clojure app I made that displays my most recent `#wwd` tweet.
