     A 0-Player Game for the Whole Family

         THE GAME AS SHE IS PLAYED

     1. Any live cell with fewer than
        two live neighbors dies (as if
        by underpopulation).
     2. Any live cell with two or three
        live neighbors lives on to the
        next generation.
     3. Any live cell with more than
        three live neighbors dies (as
        if by overcrowding).
     4. Any dead cell with exactly three
        live neighbors becomes a live
        cell (as if by reproduction).
