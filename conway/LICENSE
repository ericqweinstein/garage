THE BEERWARE LICENSE (Revision 43):

I cobbled this game thing together (with much owed to Richard
Harrington, whom I owe a beer). As long as you retain this notice,
you can do whatever you want with the code. If we meet someday, and
you think this stuff is worth it, you can buy me a beer in return.
