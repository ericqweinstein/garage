Spock
=====

##Description

Spock is an IRC chat bot written in Haskell, pretty much straight from [the Haskell wiki](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Roll_your_own_IRC_bot). As I actually become decent at writing Haskells, he'll become much more useful (in the sense that he'll be able to do things).
